# fireos-karat-decompiled

A machine-readable map of **Fire OS 8** (Android 11) on the **Fire TV Stick 4K, 2nd gen** (`AFTKRT`, codename `karat`, build `RS8182.3811N`, OTA `0032548774788`): every package, component, intent action, content provider, permission and dependency, plus declaration-level indexes of every package and framework JAR that contains code.

> **Legal:** independent interoperability research, not affiliated with or endorsed by Amazon. No Amazon code, binaries, assets or keys are included. Not legal advice. See [Legal](#legal).

> **About the name:** "decompiled" describes how these indexes were made. The firmware was decompiled locally, and only derived facts (names, signatures, numbers) are published here, never the decompiled code itself.

Built for coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor…) and people building Fire TV launchers or debloated ROMs, such as [Glass](https://github.com/AazainKhan/glass-tv-launcher) and [Glass OS](https://github.com/AazainKhan/glass-os). Ask "what listens to BOOT_COMPLETED?" or "what breaks if I remove X?" without pulling a 750 MB OTA.

**This repo contains no Amazon code, APKs, images or artwork.** It holds names, signatures, intent strings and dependency facts derived from the firmware, plus scripts that regenerate everything from your own copy of the OTA. See [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md).

## What's inside

| Path | What it is | Rows |
|---|---|---|
| `index/packages.tsv` | Every package: APK path, sharedUserId, HOME category, persistent, counts | 280 |
| `index/components.tsv` | Every activity, service, receiver, provider: exported or not, guard permission | 2,593 |
| `index/actions.tsv` | Intent actions and categories each package handles | 2,057 |
| `index/providers.tsv` | Content provider authorities | 191 |
| `index/permissions.tsv` | Permissions each package declares, with protection level | 1,781 |
| `index/native.tsv` | Native symbols from every shared object: `jni` entry points, `export`, `import` | 422,440 |
| `data/manifests.json` | Full manifest DB (uses-permission, uses-library, components, authorities) | 280 |
| `data/graph.json` | Dependency graph: who needs whom, and why (permission, library, meta-data) | |
| `data/classification.tsv` | KEEP / REMOVE / INVESTIGATE verdict per package, with reason | |
| `data/remove-candidates.tsv` | Removal batches proven safe by the lint gate | |
| `index/java/<pkg>.classes.tsv` | Classes, superclass, interfaces (bundled third-party libraries excluded) | 298 code units (223 APKs + 75 JARs) |
| `index/java/<pkg>.members.tsv` | Method and field declarations, no bodies | |
| `index/java/<pkg>.strings.tsv` | Intent actions, extras, URIs, settings keys and properties referenced in code | |
| `docs/findings.md` | Triage and first facts (auto-pair triggers, home start strategies, HOME competitors) | |
| `docs/package-classification.md` | Per-package removal evidence | |

Every APK with code (223) and every framework JAR (75, named `jar-<name>`, for example `jar-framework`, `jar-services`, `jar-fosframework`, `jar-fosservices`) is decompiled and indexed. The other 57 APKs are resource-only (overlays, `framework-res`); jadx produces only a resource-ID class for them. Bundled third-party libraries (androidx, Kotlin, Google, Glide…) are filtered out.

## Coverage

What has been decompiled and indexed, measured against the Fire OS 8 OTA.

| Area | Done | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| Manifests indexed (components, actions, providers, permissions) | 280 of 280 APKs | **100%** |
| Dependency graph | 280 of 280 APKs, 1,247 edges | **100%** |
| APKs with code decompiled (jadx) | 223 of 223 | **100%** |
| Framework JARs decompiled (`framework`, `services`, Fire OS `fos*`, Amazon SDKs) | 75 of 75 | **100%** |
| Resource-only APKs (overlays, `framework-res`): no code to decompile | 57 | n/a |
| Native code (`.so` libraries, daemons, HALs) | 0 of 582 files (477 `.so` + 105 binaries, 140 MB) | 0%, not started |

### Totals

| Measure | Count |
|---|---|
| Java files produced by jadx (local only) | 201,408 (183,130 from APKs, 18,278 from JARs) |
| Classes indexed | 175,081 |
| Method and field declarations indexed | 1,890,893 |
| Integration strings (intent actions, extras, URIs, settings keys, properties) | 42,146 |
| Components | 2,593 (377 exported) |
| Intent actions and categories | 2,057 |
| Content providers | 191 |
| Declared permissions | 1,781 |

### Largest code units

| Unit | Classes | Members | Integration strings |
|---|---|---|---|
| `jar-framework` (Android framework) | 14,937 | 226,606 | 4,647 |
| `com.amazon.tv.launcher` | 11,954 | 96,405 | 1,397 |
| `com.amazon.tahoe` (Kids) | 9,500 | 128,205 | 949 |
| `com.amazon.venezia` (Appstore) | 9,478 | 80,857 | 4,108 |
| `com.amazon.vizzini` (Alexa) | 9,424 | 95,895 | 1,843 |
| `com.amazon.tv.livetv` | 6,509 | 52,475 | 986 |
| `com.amazon.aria` | 5,403 | 37,616 | 477 |
| `com.amazon.ftv.screensaver` | 4,595 | 38,092 | 367 |
| `com.amazon.tv.devicecontrol` | 4,484 | 41,606 | 709 |
| `jar-services` (system server) | 4,450 | 63,801 | 3,106 |

Every unit has its own `index/java/<unit>.classes.tsv`, `.members.tsv` and `.strings.tsv`. Java files are the raw jadx output and stay local; only the declarations and strings are published.

## Use cases

For agents working on a Fire TV launcher, ROM or companion app:

1. **Take over Home cleanly.** Find every package that claims HOME and what re-asserts it at boot.
   `awk -F'\t' '$4=="true"' index/packages.tsv` and `grep -h BOOT_COMPLETED index/java/*.strings.tsv`
2. **Debloat with evidence.** Before removing a package, see who depends on it and why.
   `python3 -c "import json;g=json.load(open('data/graph.json'));print(g['rev'].get('com.amazon.aria'))"`
   Then gate the batch: `python3 scripts/lint_removals.py data/manifests.json data/libs_features.txt data/remove-candidates.tsv`
3. **Deep-link into Fire settings.** List exported settings activities and the actions they accept.
   `grep com.amazon.tv.settings.v2 index/components.tsv | awk -F'\t' '$4=="yes"'`
4. **Fix the remote pairing behaviour.** See what triggers AutoPairService and what it broadcasts.
   `cat index/java/com.amazon.autopairservice.strings.tsv`
5. **Interoperate with casting.** Find the DIAL, Miracast and WhisperPlay receivers and their intents before adding an AirPlay or Cast receiver alongside.
   `grep -E "dialservice|cast.sink|whisperlink" index/actions.tsv`
6. **Find the permission you need.** Which package declares a permission, and at what protection level, so you know if an APK can request it.

## Native code

`index/native.tsv` is `package, lib, kind, symbol`, from `nm -D` over every `*.so` in the extracted image - names only,
no disassembly, and no NDK needed. `kind` is `jni` (a `Java_*` entry point, i.e. names the APK's `native` methods bind
to), `export`, or `import` (an undefined symbol, so something else must supply it).

Two things to know before trusting the `package` column:

- Only the system image is indexed, so an app **updated into `/data`** appears as its component-less stub. `com.amazon.aiondec`
  is the worked example: the image holds `com.amazon.aiondec-stub` (0 components) while the live app in `/data/app` has 17,
  including `SkillConnectionActivity` and `SendTextActivity` behind `amzn://`. Dump the device's APK to see those.
- `package` is set only where a lib sits **inside an app's directory**. Most app libs are shared platform libs under
  `/system/lib` with no back-pointer, so they carry an empty package; 7 packages are attributed. Reading the `jni` and
  `import` rows is still useful without it, and the Java index gives the app side.
   `grep -i bluetooth index/permissions.tsv`
7. **Diff Fire OS updates.** Re-run on a newer OTA and `git diff index/` to see new components, actions and permissions.

## Regenerate from your own OTA

Needs Python 3, `brotli`, `e2fsprogs` (`debugfs`), Android build-tools (`aapt2`), `jadx`, and [`sdat2img.py`](https://github.com/xpirt/sdat2img).

```bash
SDAT2IMG=/path/to/sdat2img.py scripts/reproduce.sh /path/to/update-kindle-karat-RS8182_user_3811_0032548774788.bin
```

Extracted partitions and jadx output go to `.work/` (git-ignored). Note: the indexes in this repo were produced step by step from the same OTA; the script collects those steps but has not yet been run end to end in one pass.

| Script | Does |
|---|---|
| `scripts/manifest_db.py` | APKs → manifest DB (aapt2) |
| `scripts/graph.py` | manifest DB + libraries → dependency graph |
| `scripts/lint_removals.py` | fails a removal list that would break a kept package |
| `scripts/index_components.py` | manifest DB → components, actions, providers, permissions TSVs |
| `scripts/index_jadx.py` | jadx output → class, member and string-constant TSVs (no code bodies) |

## Legal

**Not legal advice.** This section describes how the project is intended to be used. It is not legal advice; if you need certainty for your situation or jurisdiction, ask a lawyer.

**No affiliation.** This project is not affiliated with, authorised, sponsored or endorsed by Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates.

**What this repository is.** Independent research for interoperability: the indexes describe how Fire OS is structured so that third-party software (launchers, companion apps, accessibility tools, custom builds for devices you own) can work with it. The repository contains only facts derived from the firmware (names, paths, declared signatures, configuration values and numbers) and original scripts written for this project.

**What it is not.** It does not contain, and pull requests must not add:
- Amazon binaries, firmware, disk images, packages or installers;
- decompiled or disassembled code, method bodies, generated header files or source reconstructions;
- images, icons, sounds, fonts, `Assets.car`/resource files or other artwork;
- encryption keys, certificates, signing material, credentials or tokens, including any found embedded in the firmware;
- anything that removes, disables or works around copy protection or DRM.

**Get the firmware yourself.** The reproduce scripts expect a firmware file that you obtained lawfully. They do not download it for you, and everything they extract stays in a git-ignored local directory. Do not commit or share that directory.

**DRM stays untouched.** DRM and provisioning components (Widevine, Amazon DRM provisioning, licensing in the Appstore runtime) are listed only so they can be left alone. This project never documents how to bypass them, and any keys or secrets embedded in the firmware are deliberately excluded from every index.

**Your responsibility.** You are responsible for making sure your use complies with the laws of your jurisdiction and with any agreements you have accepted (for example the device's terms of use or the software licence agreement). Reverse engineering for interoperability is permitted in many jurisdictions under specific conditions, but not everywhere and not for every purpose.

**No warranty, use at your own risk.** The scripts and data are provided "as is", without warranty of any kind (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)). Modifying a device's software can void its warranty, break features or make the device unusable. The authors are not liable for any damage or loss.

**Takedown and contact.** If you are a rights holder and believe something here should not be published, open an issue (or contact the repository owner through GitHub) and it will be reviewed and removed promptly. Security-sensitive reports should not be filed as public issues; use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting on this repository instead.
